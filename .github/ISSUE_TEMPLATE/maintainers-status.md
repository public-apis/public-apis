Hi community,

This message is to clarify the current situation around the Public APIs repository, explain why maintainers are frustrated, and request a constructive response from APILayer (the organization that currently owns the repo). We're posting this to be transparent with the community and to ask for help so the project can continue to thrive.

Short summary
- A small team of maintainers — @matheusfelipeog, @pawelborkar, @marekdano and @yannbertrand — revived the project after a prolonged period of inactivity. We reduced a backlog of hundreds of PRs and issues, and have merged many improvements since then.
- Recently, our repository-level access was lowered without prior communication. Several repository settings and project policies were modified (by the account `apilayer-admin`) in ways that broke tests and CI.
- We have tried repeatedly to contact APILayer staff and founders to coordinate and request collaboration or transfer. Most attempts have not received replies.
- We are asking APILayer to either grant maintainers the permissions needed to manage and evolve the project, or to transfer the repository to maintainers who will continue maintenance responsibly.

What we (the maintainers) accomplished
- Reopened and triaged the project when it had hundreds of open PRs and dozens of unresolved issues.
- Resolved the initial backlog in ~2 months and continued active maintenance: since then we’ve merged many PRs and resolved dozens of issues.
- Kept the project healthy, improved CI, and added project improvements used by the community.

Key recent problems
- Unauthorized/undocumented changes by `apilayer-admin` broke tests, CI, or project policies. (See commit history for context.)
- On a recent date, maintainers' access levels were reduced without communication. We can no longer reach basic repository settings needed for maintenance.
- Attempts to coordinate with APILayer representatives (employees, ex-employees, and founders) have not produced a helpful response.

What we’ve tried
- Outreach to APILayer employees and ex-employees by maintainers.
- Reaching out to leadership (including John Burr, APILayer GM), but we have not received meaningful replies for months.
- Public posts and blog posts to raise awareness (see links below).

What we ask APILayer to do
Please choose one of the following, or propose an alternative plan in discussion with us:
1. Grant the current maintainers (listed above) the organization and repository permissions necessary to continue managing the project (owner/member with appropriate repo rights). This will allow us to fix settings, restore CI, and accept community contributions.
2. If APILayer does not wish to continue active maintenance, transfer the repository to one of the maintainers or to a new organization controlled by active maintainers so the community can continue to benefit from a well-maintained list.

How the community can help
- If you represent APILayer or know someone at APILayer who can help, please reply or tag them here.
- If you’re a maintainer or contributor and can help with triage, CI fixes, or moderation, reach out to the maintainers.
- Please avoid adding inappropriate or low-quality entries that could harm the project's usefulness.

Tone and intent
We are not trying to be confrontational. We want to work with APILayer to ensure the project remains useful and well-managed. We are asking for collaboration and transparency so the community isn’t adversely affected.

Closing
We'd appreciate a response from APILayer representatives (or a point of contact) so we can agree on a plan: either restore needed permissions or transfer ownership to active maintainers. If APILayer prefers another path, we’re open to discussing alternatives that ensure the project remains healthy.

Thank you,
The maintainers: @matheusfelipeog, @pawelborkar, @marekdano, @yannbertrand
